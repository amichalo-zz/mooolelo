# mooolelo

### About

Mooolelo is a word from Hawaiian language which can be translated as registry or record.

Basically mooolelo is a simple services registry. It is language independent and clients communicate with it via HTTP requests, so you can keep track of all your services from one place. Project name is not just a crazy coincidence, tool is powerful (or at least it will be in the future) and still very agile. Almost all parts data, you can store in registry, are optional. It allows you to tailor it to your needs, registering at the same time and in the same way, both big services, which are full of metadata, as well as small microservices.

Although this project is being used in production environment it's still in a very early stage, so please report bugs through GitHub issues.
